I am Bryan Castleman, I am a web developer with some previous graphic and web design experience. 

This is my #100DaysOfCode blog where I write about my progress in the [100DaysOfCode](http://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge. 

My personal motivation for joining this challenge is that I want to build a strong case for myself to become employed as a Front End Developer, to strengthen [my portfolio](http://castleman.work), and solidify my understanding of certain concepts and gain new skills.

You can find me on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/castlemaninc/), [Github](https://github.com/castlemaninc), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryancastleman/).

**I want to grow and solidify my understanding of the following things:**

- CSS3 (CSS Grid, Flexbox, variables, etc.)
- Vanilla JavaScript / ES6 / jQuery
- CSS Preprocessing (SASS)
- Task Runner Experience (Gulp)
- Responsive Design
- Node.js and NPM packages
- Front-end templating (Handlebars or Pug)
- UI/UX Concepts
- React / Redux or Vue.js
- JSON, AJAX, lazy-loading concepts and implementation methods
- CSS Animations and javascript GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform)
- Wordpress Development &amp; PHP
- Using SVG
