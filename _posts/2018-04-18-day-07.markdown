**Focus**: (Goal #2) JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: I learned how to use the JavaScript array [reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) method. 

**Thoughts**: Learning 'higher-order functions' such as filter, map, and reduce method is a major step forward for me as a JavaScript developer. I am going to incorporate these into my code as much as possible.
