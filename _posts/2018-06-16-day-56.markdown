**Focus**: Vue.js 

**Today's Progress**: I decided to go back and work on my first Vue application so that I can fix the bug in the input forms, which caused the item numbers to show up in every single input box. I was able to fix the problem, and learned some new things in the Vue.js documentation such as .number modifier. 

**Thoughts**: I think I might want to spend the rest of my 100 days learning only Vue so that I can progress further in one JS framework rather than jump back and forth between Vue and React.
