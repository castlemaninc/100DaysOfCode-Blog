**Focus**: (Goal #2) JavaScript

**Today's Progress**: Realizing that I need to learn the JavaScript reduce() method. 

I made progress on re-writing my Front End Developer résumé. 

**Thoughts**: I realized that I had already solved the Map the Debris algorithm challenge back in October 2017, so I worked on another one called [Exact Change](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/exact-change). After struggling to find a solution to the Advanced Algorithm challenge, I read the hints provided. I realized that the solution to the problem used the reduce method which I don't fully understand. I really want to solve the problem for myself, and I will revisit this to complete on another day.
