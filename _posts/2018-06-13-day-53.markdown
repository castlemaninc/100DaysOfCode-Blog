**Focus**: Vue.js 

**Today's Progress**: I began to follow along with a tutorial that uses the Vue CLI to set up a new project. The project is a portfolio website. The first part of the tutorial demonstrated the design process in AdobeXD. 

**Thoughts**: This is the workflow that I want to utilize in all of my projects from here on out. The Vue CLI is a better way to set up a project. It is a lot like create-react-app for React. 

Some things I like about this tutorial is that the teacher, uses Sass instead of CSS, and also CSS grid.
