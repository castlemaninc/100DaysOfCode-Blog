**Focus**: 

**Today's Progress**: My primary goal for today is to apply to at least 5 jobs, and spend about 2 hours on those applications.

I'm also converting the last 30 days of my 100DaysOfCode log into markdown for this Jekyll blog.

**Thoughts**: I'm juggling a Wordpress site, designing a layout in Adobe XD, applying to jobs, redacting my resume, etc.
