**Focus**: Sass

**Today's Progress**: I finished all of the Sass modules in the freeCodeCamp curriculum. 

**Thoughts**: This was an easy way to try some of the Sass features that I haven't used yet, such as extending a class, and writing a @while loop, or using @each, or writing conditional logic with @if and @else.
