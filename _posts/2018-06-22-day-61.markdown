**Focus**: React.js 

**Today's Progress**: I did about 30 of the React exercises in the freeCodeCamp curriculum. 

**Thoughts**: It's nice to revisit React.js concepts to see what I remember after spending time with Vue.js. I'm interested to see how far along I can get with freeCodeCamp's section on Redux and then React and Redux combined.
