**Focus**: (Goal #1) CSS3 (CSS Grid, Flexbox, variables, etc.)

**Today's Progress**: I gained a deeper understanding of flexbox properties by building something that demonstrates them visually.  

**Thoughts**: I initially wanted to animate one flexbox property change to another, but learned that this is more difficult than I imagined it would be. I know it is possible with a library like Greensock. I want to make it work on all device sizes and add animations. I also want to add more flexbox properties and values.
