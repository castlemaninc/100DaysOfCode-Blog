**Focus**: (Goal #1) CSS3

**Today's Progress**: I learned more about the CSS box-shadow property and positioning elements to make use of the Z-axis with z-index. 

**Thoughts**: After watching videos on Material Design. I made a quick project to practice the CSS box-shadow, CSS z-index property, and element positioning. Here is the Github repo.
