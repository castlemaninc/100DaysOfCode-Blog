**Focus**: (Goal #2, #5, #9) JavaScript & HTML, Flexbox, and React 

**Today's Progress**: 
1. I solved an algorithm challege on Codewars using Array.prototype.reduce().
2. I continued working with Flexbox properties in a responsive portfolio layout by adding new pages.
3. I cloned a friend's github repo, to see if I can help solve her problems in her React application.  

**Thoughts**: I am happy to finally implement the reduce method. I am trying to understand the philosophy behind building React applications vs. web applications built in other ways. I spent a lot of time today diagramming the component structure of the React version of the responsive portfolio.
