**Focus**: Vue.js 

**Today's Progress**: I wrote some code in my Tic Tac Toe app to evaluate the game board and determine if there is a winner. I was able to use the forEach array function in my work. 

I also continued to read about Vue.js on CSS-Tricks and in the official Vue Guide where I used the Vue DevTools to manipulate some of the examples.
