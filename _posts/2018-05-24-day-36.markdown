**Focus**: SVG, CSS Transform, CSS Grid, ES6, 

**Today's Progress**: Today I drew a Rubik's Cube in CSS using 3 CSS grids and the CSS transform property. I also drew an SVG image for the Classic 80's game called "Simon". I brought the SVG code into Codepen, and I am getting the game functional. 

**Thoughts**: Drawing SVGs is a game-changer for me. I really like it and it opens up a lot of new ideas for me.
