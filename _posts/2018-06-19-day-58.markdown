**Focus**: Vue.js Networking

**Today's Progress**: I went to a Vue.js meetup at Learning Fuze in Irvine, CA. It was taught by a man named Kobi Levy from The CodeUp Club. The event was put on by JavaScriptLA. 

I also continued to work with my first Vue.js application to break it down into components. 

**Thoughts**: I need to go to more meetups.
