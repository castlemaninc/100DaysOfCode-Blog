**Focus**: (Goal #12) Wordpress Development & PHP 

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to write PHP variables, functions, and loops. I'm also learning how to integrate my own layouts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into Wordpress. 

**Thoughts**: I'm hoping to go through this video series quickly so that I can build this site fast and move on to another project in React or Vue.
