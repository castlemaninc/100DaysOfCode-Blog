**Focus**: (Goal #1 CSS)

**Today's Progress**: I added some MaterializeCSS classes to my Pomodoro Clock app on Codepen. I also deleted the skills section from my portfolio website.

**Thoughts**: I had to re-center icons inside of the Materialize buttons and the CSS child combinator selector (>) was useful in selecting the graphic.
