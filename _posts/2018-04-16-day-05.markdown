**Focus**: (Goals #2 & #11) JavaScript & GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform)

**Today's Progress**: I got GSAP set up in my project, and animated an element on the screen. 

**Thoughts**: I watched [Getting Started with GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/get-started-js) and was able to get GSAP working locally. I spent most of my day trying to figure out if I could animate or tween Flexbox property changes. I was unsuccesful in that regard. I plan to incorporate GSAP into my coding repertoire.
