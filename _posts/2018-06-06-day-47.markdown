**Focus**: Fetch, Coding Challenge, GET, POST

**Today's Progress**: I worked on a 2-part coding challenge as part of a job application. The job application asked me to perform a GET to a URL with a few parameters. The second part asked me to perform a POST, passing in required headers, and send it in properly formatted JSON. 

**Thoughts**: A couple of tools I utilized were JSONLint and POSTMAN.
