**Focus**: Applied Visual Design 

**Today's Progress**: I did about 20 modules in the Applied Visual Design section of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. I learned about some HTML tags that I rarely see. 

**Thoughts**: Most of this has been review for me but I'm still curious about what is contained in this section of their curriculum.
