**Focus**: Vue.js 

**Today's Progress**: I finished more of the Intro to Vue.js tutorials and I started a new Vue.js project of my own. I'm recreating a gold/silver coin buying app that I began in ReactJS. I want to integrate an API for spot prices, so that coin prices can change.

**Thoughts**: So far so good.
