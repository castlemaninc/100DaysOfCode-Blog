**Focus**: (Goal #12 Wordpress Development & PHP)

**Today's Progress** I learned more about the variety of Wordpress functions I could employ, and about dynamic navigation in WP

**Thoughts**: At this point, I think I want to try to code things and utilize a Wordpress Cheat Sheet to see if I can solve problems on my own.
