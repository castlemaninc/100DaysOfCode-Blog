**Focus**: (Goals #3 & #4) Sass & Gulp.js

**Today's Progress**: I wrote and used to gulp tasks succesfully. I was able to compile SCSS to CSS and have file changes automatically compiled with every file save. 

**Thoughts**: I am happy about learning gulp. This was a mini milestone in my personal goals to become an employed Front End Developer. I was able to write more Sass too.
