**Focus**: ES6 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Simon game application. Now, I can refactor the code.    

**Thoughts**: This was my first application with an SVG that I created. So that was an accomplishment. I'm going to review some games written in object-oriented JavaScript to think about how I could have coded this application differently.
