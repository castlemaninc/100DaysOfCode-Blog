**Focus**: Vue.js 

**Today's Progress**: I followed along with the Intro to Vue.js course on Vue Mastery. I did a few coding challenges and was able to complete them all pretty easily. 

**Thoughts**: The courses on here are really well done and I'm way more excited about building apps with Vue.js now.
