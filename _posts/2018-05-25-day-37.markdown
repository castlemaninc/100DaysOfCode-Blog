**Focus**: SVG, ES6 

**Today's Progress**: Made a lot of headway on the Simon game I am building on Codepen. I improved the vector art, and made the svg code better.     

**Thoughts**:  After starting to code the game Simon on Codepen, I realized that I needed to group parts in Adobe Illustrator layers to get groups in the SVG code. I also drew some button states, and all of the numbers for the scoreboard.
