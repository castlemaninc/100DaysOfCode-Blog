**Focus**: (Goal #9) React

**Today's Progress**: Continuing to learn ReactJS, and about passing static props from a parent to a child.   

**Thoughts**: I'm able to build a responsive portfolio website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. However, rebuilding the same thing in ReactJS is very different process. 
- In order to utilize Font Awesome an npm package is required. 
- I also need to be able to replace animations created by jQuery.
