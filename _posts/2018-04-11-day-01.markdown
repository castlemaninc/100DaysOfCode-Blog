**Focus**: (Goal #2) CSS Preprocesser

**Today's Progress**: I wrote my first Sass and compiled it to CSS. 

**Thoughts:** I wanted to get some experience writing SCSS and compiling it to CSS. I also wanted to practice CSS Animation. I compiled with a command every time I made changes. I would like to try gulp to take care of this for me.
