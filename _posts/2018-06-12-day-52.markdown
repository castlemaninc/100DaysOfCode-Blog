**Focus**: Vue.js 

**Today's Progress**: I have most of the pieces working in my first Vue.js app. I was able to accomplish some attribute binding, conditional rendering, and some event handling. Except, I have one bug where the numerical input shows up in all input fields on the page. 

**Thoughts**: I have to refactor the structure of the application into reusable components. If I can make my application work with real data that would be great. I think I can use Axios, but more research is necessary before I can do that.
