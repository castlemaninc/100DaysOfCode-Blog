Today I installed Ruby on my machine in order to utilize Jekyll for this blog. I wanted to be able to quickly write a blog post in markdown and host it on Github Pages. 

This morning I cleaned up code on in my personal portfolio. I deleted unused CSS code, and added comments. I also moved some scripts to my main JavaScript file.
