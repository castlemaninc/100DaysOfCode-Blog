**Focus**: SVG, Layout, Animation

**Today's Progress**: I learned about a new animation library called Anime.js and I also learned about using SVGs backgrounds in web design.    

**Thoughts**: This is very helpful to me since I have a lot of experience with Adobe Illustrator. I'm going to be able to incorporate this stuff into all of my layouts, relying less on designing and creating shapes with CSS alone.
