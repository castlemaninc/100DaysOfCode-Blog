**Focus**: SVG, Greensock GSAP

**Today's Progress**: I was having trouble with a mouse event on a transparent SVG. I found out about 'pointer-events: bounding-box' which solved my problem. I was able to get the start button on the start screen to work, and for other svg elements to hide and show so that a player can begin a game. 

I also was able to animate the grid lines on the Tic-Tac-Toe board with GSAP. 

**Thoughts**: I really like SVG and Greensock. I need to learn how to modify the SVG code that Adobe Illustrator produces so that I can have efficient ways of displaying and hiding elements.
